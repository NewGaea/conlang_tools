'''
The goal of this tool is to allow conlangers to use custom alphabetic
sorting for their projects. The script imports two files, a Sorting
List to define the order of symbols used to alphabetize and a
Dictionary List to be sorted.

The script will overwrite the Dictionary File when it is finished,
unless it is called with the third parameter set as "--new"

If called without any arguments, the script may prompt the user for
each of the necessary files
