## Arrows / Eastmost
### EASTMOST PENNINSULA IS THE SECRET
### オカネガナクナレバ　ヤ　ハ　ツカエナイ
"*Okane ga naku nareba ya wa tsukaenai*," is the romanization of this hint, which roughly means, "Without money, the arrow can't be used."
### DODONGO DISLIKES SMOKE

### DID YOU GET THE SWORD FROM THE OLD MAN ON TOP OF THE WATERFALL

### WALK INTO THE WATERFALL
## Pol's Voice Hint
Like the Eastmost Penninsula (sic) above, this line was significantly changed in the English language release, but unlike that one, this was for a reason: the special weakness of the enemy *Pol's Voice* was changed between the original Famicom and NES releases! In the NES release, *Pol's Voice* is vulnerable to arrows, while on the Famicom it was weak to sound from the Player 2 controller's microphone. Translations of both the English and Japanese hints are included here:
### SECRET POWER IS SAID TO BE IN THE ARROW

### オトニヨワイイキモノガイル
This line "*oto ni yowai ikimono ga iru,*" means something like "Sound is the weakness of certain creatures." Some translations say, "There are creatures which are sensitive to sound." As mentioned above, this is a hint to defeat the *Pol's Voice* enemies by using the microphone feature of the Famicom's Player 2 controller.

### DIGDOGGER HATES CERTAIN KIND OF SOUND

### I BET YOU'D LIKE TO HAVE MORE BOMBS

### THERE ARE SECRETS WHERE FAIRIES DON'T LIVE

### AIM AT THE EYES OF GOHMA

## Tip of the Nose, Entrance to Death, Seek the Arrows
Once again, we find a line which was massively changed from Japanese to English. In English, this becomes an apparently obscure hint about a single room in Level 7 (there's a secret passage), while the original gave you a hint a bit further out than the current dungeon...

### THERE'S A SECRET IN THE TIP OF THE NOSE

The Japanese hint here was more like:
### SPECTACLE ROCK IS AN ENTRANCE TO DEATH

This hint was moved from Level 7 (see the above hint!) to Level 8, and the man in Level 8 here originally said:
### デスマウンテンデ　ヤラ　サガセ
Romanized as "*DEATH MOUNTAIN yara sagase*," this lets the player know something hugely important: There are arrows in Death Mountain that you should seek out. As these are necessary to defeat the final boss, this hint is so important.

## 10th Enemy? Lion's Key?
### 10TH ENEMY HAS THE BOMB
Another interesting and drastic change. This hint is true, but obscured heavily by it's simple wording.

This is because the original Japanese text read:
### ライオンノカギヲサガセ
```ngloss
\ex KUHIRO LONAK INDA NUQETOCHI
\ft Seek the King's Key
```

There are three major items in Level 9, or Death Mountain -- and this is the second hint to look for them.
## Death Mountain - Level 9
## ONES WHO DOES NOT HAVE TRIFORCE CAN'T GO IN

## PATRA HAS THE MAP
The NES releases claim that Patra (a monster first seen in Level 8) has the map for Level 9:

But the original Japanese hint was:
### イチバンウエ　ノ　サカ　イメヲ　コクセ
Romanized as "*ichiban ue no saka ime wo kokuse*" this means "Destroy the topmost boundary." This is once again a hint to an item hidden in Level 9 -- this time the way to find the room where the Red Ring is hidden.

## GO TO THE NEXT ROOM

## Eyes of Skull / Red Ring
## EYES OF SKULL HAS A SECRET

This line was originally:
### アカイユビクヲ　ミツケ　タカイ

## End Sequence
## THANKS LINK, YOU'RE THE HERO OF HYRULE

## FINALLY, PEACE RETURNS TO HYRULE.THIS ENDS THE STORY.
### Finally, peace returns to Hyrule.
### This ends the story.
