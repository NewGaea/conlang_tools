# JoJo and the Big Mess

This is a translation, page by page, of _JoJo and the Big Mess_ by Jane O'Connor.

## Usage (Remove For Use)

This file is prepared for use in Obsidian, using the Interlinear Glossing addon. However, it is our hope that by using line-separated entries in the multiline gloss format, that we can produce readable glosses even in other text editors which may or may not use Markdown.

We have prepared a minimal setup for each gloss block in the book, but for more detailed information you should refer to the Interlinear Glossing addon's documentation, or the sample translation file included in this project.

Commented lines are lines which are intentionally left optional, but are still transcribed for those who choose to translate absolutely everything.
