# Translation Projects

This directory houses a variety of larger projects for translation. This is intended for larger projects, like whole books, documents, shows, or games. These may be used to test the robustness of a language in general, or for specific purposes.

The projects are offered in several predefined groups -- games, literature, music, etc. -- with subcategories based on a combination of size and difficulty. For example, we provide text for select books based on a combination of target audience ages, reading difficulty, and length. More advanced books may be divided into files per chapter or even sections.

These books are provided in text-only form and prepared for glossing or translation into a conlang. We do not provide any images for the books, and we interpret that so long as these translations and glosses are not used for profit, the educational and analytical purpose of this distribution is justified. If you wish to publish any of these translations for profit, you will need to contact the original holder(s) of the rights.

## Games

This category covers any translation for any sort of game, whether tabletop, electronic, video game, or even just a set of rules for sporting or other types of game. In some cases, these texts may be sets of rules, while in others they may include narratives for games.

## Literature

This category covers prose, especially fictional. The subcategories are largely divided by rough target age ranges, with categories Early Reader (ages under 6, US pre-school and kindergarten ages), Children (ages 6-11), Young Adult (12-18), Mainstream (contemporary 16+), and Classic (pre-contemporary, often particularly notable works in the UK or US Cultural spheres).

### Non-Fiction

While we currently provide no non-fiction writing sample, we hope to be able to offer a variety of non-fiction prose as well.

## Technical

This category covers particularly non-fiction, non-prose, and non-verse writings, such as legal documents or drafts, recipes, assembly instructions, or formal papers and essays. We are not presently certain how we will sub-categorize this, and will determine this as we acquire such resources. The only subcategory we know at this time is that we _will_ treat most Religious and Philosophical texts under this category

### Religious & Philosophical

This category covers translations of religious texts, mythology, and similar. They are subcategorized by religion or philosophy. The general exception to this is that religious poetry and lyrics will be categorized under Poetry instead.

## Poetry & Verse

Poetry is a special category which can be translated and adapted in various ways, and deserves to be treated separately from prose and technical or mythological writings. This category includes music and lyrics as well as spoken word, comedy, and other forms of playful writing. Note that some literature adopts poetic techniques, and can be classified in either -- a translator's choice to focus on prose or poetry may lead to a change in classification by you as you work to translate a project.
