# conlang_tools

A collection of tools for conlanging

This repository contains prompts and tests to help you build up your conlang.

You can find nicely formatted Markdown versions of texts including literature, poetry, music, religious texts, and miscellaneous amusing pop culture. Most of these are considered to be a case of fair use under the copyright laws of the USA, and any request through proper channels to remove a particular sample will be honoroed.

There is also a collection of prompts from r/conlangs -- while we are beginning this with only the prompots from Lexember 2018-2021, we hope to extend the archive of Lexember prompts each year, and will be keeping an eye out for useful discussion threads about topics that help prompt us to think more about our languages!
