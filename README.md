# conlang_tools

A collection of tools for conlanging.

This repository contains prompts and tests to help you build up your conlang.

## Prompts

You can find nicely formatted Markdown versions of texts including literature, poetry, music, religious texts, and miscellaneous amusing pop culture. Most of these are considered to be a case of fair use under the copyright laws of the USA, and any request through proper channels to remove a particular sample will be honored.

There is also a collection of prompts from r/conlangs -- while we are beginning this with only the prompots from Lexember 2018-2021, we hope to extend the archive of Lexember prompts each year, and will be keeping an eye out for useful discussion threads about topics that help prompt us to think more about our languages!

## Tests

There are also a number of tests that you can use to evaluate your conlang. These are not meant to be a complete evaluation of your conlang, but rather a way to get a quick sense of how well your conlang is doing in a particular area.
