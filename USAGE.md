# Usage of this Repository & Vault

This repository is a clean archive of an Obsidian Vault, without any of the .obsidian files or settings included. This file summarizes how to use this vault in general, whether you are using Obsidian or some other editor for your language projects. In all cases, the files within this vault are formatted using Markdown, and we try to keep our usage as standard as we can, without reliance on Obsidian-specific features, extensions, or styles of use.

## Attribution

Any file with an **Attribution** section is provided with the condition that you *must* preserve all of the text in that section to properly attribute the original authors, composers, lyricists, and transcribers who put their time into preparing the file for your use. You may add your own attribution to this section, but you may not delete anything.

You may also add a translation of the Attribution in any other language, but you may not remove the original English language attribution without permission from Oztin (linguaRoo) to replace it with a reviewed and approved translation.

## Use of Files

The easiest way to use this project is to copy the files you want into your own project structure, regardless of the structure. This can be as simple and copying and pasting the file into your project structure, or copying and pasting the text in the file into your editor of choice. While we cannot guarantee that Word Processors will automatically convert the formatting, this will still give you a big head-start on the file.

## Use of Folders

Folders may be used in their entirety, and the folder structure may even be altered as necessary to fit your project. You may also combine files or folders into a larger single-file project. We do not place any restrictions on the management of the directory tree for our friends using this project, only on their requirement to attribute the work done where attribution is provided.

## Use in IDEs, Project Management Software, or Journals

Opening the root folder or directory in any Project Management software should be all that is necessary to use these files in environments such as VSCode, Eclipse, or other IDEs or Project management systems. This is the easiest way to take advantage of all the resources available here, as some of the tools we provide are programs or source code you can compile and run yourself.

## Use in Obsidian

We believe the best option for using this repository is to open it as a Vault in Obsidian, as a template for your new conlang projects, or by copying the files or text of files into your conlang project vaults or folders. We have developed it across various software over several years, and find Obsidian to be an ideal, extensible tool for documenting our own languages.

### Obsidian Addons

We are not here to dictate what addons you must use -- this is a toolkit, after all -- but we do recommend this one addon if you are working in Obsidian: 

#### Interlinear Glossing
> [https://github.com/Mijyuoon/obsidian-ling-gloss](https://github.com/Mijyuoon/obsidian-ling-gloss)

This addon allows you to format glosses using fenced code blocks with the `gloss` or `ngloss` formatting styles. We recommend this for any sample translations in your documentation, and all of our provided glossed translation files use the `ngloss` style format by default.
