## Abbreviations

In this section, you should create a list (possibly a table) of the abbreviations an notations you will use throughout your grammar, even if these are commonplace linguistics abbreviations. This will help your reader by providing a reference for what exactly _you_ mean in your grammar when using each. At your discretion, you may also copy this list to the end of the grammar as a reference or appendix.
