# 3: Nominal Morphology

There is no need to place any information in this section before the first sub-heading.

## 3.1: Morphological Structure

What is the morphological structure of LANGNAME? Is there a strict order to the elements of a word? Can complex words be broken down by morphemic analysis? How extensive, and productive, are its inflectional and derivational systems (if any). Is there a trend to a particular size for roots? Are there any other rules in the language that a word must conform to?

What are the nominal categories of LANGNAME? Which, if any, take inflectional forms, and what forms must or may they take? Does it have gender, number, case, possession, etc?

### 3.1.1: Number

Many languages mark number, and very often this may be as broad as singular versus plural, though other varieties of grammatical number do exist. If LANGNAME uses number, how does it mark this feature? Which nominal forms take marking for number? Does inflection for number alter the stress pattern at all?

| English  | Singular | Plural    |
| -------- | -------- | --------- |
| mountain | *nonke*  | *nonkenu* |
| arrow    | *nayu*   | *nayu*    |
| cow      | *karen*  | *karenu*  |

### 3.1.2: Case

Does LANGNAME use cases to mark the role and relation of nominal elements within a sentence? How consistent are the cases, and what is each used for? Use a further subheading to explore specific cases in more detail. Are case affixes productive or not? Are any case affixes optional in any circumstance? Do they follow or break the rules of stress?

If necessary, you may want to compose an HTML table or use an image to create a more elaborate table to demonstrate how to inflect all of your cases.

Whether you use subheadings or not, this is a good place to start providing glosses to demonstrate the way the language works on the sentence level. If you properly number all of your glosses, you can refer to previous glosses where appropriate.

## 3.2: Nouns

How are nouns specifically inflected in LANGNAME? Is there a set order for inflectional elements?

\[possession] -- \[stem] -- \[derivation] -- \[number] --\[case]

Does LANGNAME have rich systems of derivation? How do these derivations work?

Are there other distinctions made amongst adjectives in LANGNAME?
## 3.3: Adjectives

Are adjectives in LANGNAME used attributively, predicatively, or both? Where are they placed relative to the word they modify? Does this change based on their role in the sentence? Do they need to agree with any (or all) of the inflectional elements of their nominal head?

## 3.4: Pronouns

What classes of pronouns does LANGNAME have? What are they called? How do they differ? Use subheadings to explore them more closely.

## 3.5: Numerals

How are cardinal numerals formed? Are they derived or independent stems? How are larger numerals than the base formed?

What about ordinal numerals? Do any ordinals use suppletive forms, or do they all follow the same rule?

Is there any form of special marking for collective numerals for nouns?
