# 9: Syntax

There is no need to place any information in this section before the first sub-heading, but a brief summary of broad and unusual syntactic features could be placed here.

## 9.1: Word Order and General Syntactic Typology

What is the general structure of the language? Is it analytic or synthetic? What subcategories does it belong to if any? What is its morphosyntactic alignment? What is its typical word order? What cases (if any) do the arguments take, and what shape do clauses or phrases within a sentence take? Is there a specific schema that can be presented for sentence structures?

What parts of a sentence are mandatory, and which are optional? How much role does context play in distinguishing the difference?

Do questions alter the word order or alignment of a sentence?

What changes are made in casual or colloquial speech as opposed to formal speech?

## 9.2: Subordination

How can clauses be joined in LANGNAME? What structures do they use, and what implications might different structures have?

## 9.3: Agreement Patterns

Is agreement an important part of LANGNAME syntax? If so, what is agreement based on? Is agreement based on the same things in different types of sentences? Does agreement ever cause changes to otherwise expected behaviors in LANGNAME?

## 9.4: Sentences with Participles and Converbs

Are participial and converbal constructions common or rare? How are these translated into ENGLISH? Is there a notable difference between participial and converbal constructions?
