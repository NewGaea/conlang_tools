# Reference Grammar Layout

This folder contains files for building a reference grammar. This structure is roughly based on the Lincom Europa grammar of Evenki, by Nadezhda Bulatova and Lenore Grenoble, which also inspired the grammars of Felix Schwarzenberg.

This layout is provided as is, and is intended to be used only as a framework -- feel free to change the structure as necessary to work for your own language project. For example, if your language has articles you may want to discuss them within the Nominal Morphology section. If your language has no Converbs, you may remove or repurpose that section.
