# 2: Phonology

There is no need to place any information in this section before the first sub-heading.

## 2.1: Vowel System

There are XV vowel phonemes in LANGNAME. The following table shows the broad forms.

|       | front | central | back |
| ----- | ----- | ------- | ---- |
| close |       |         |      |
| mid   |       |         |      |
| open  |       |         |      |

There may be narrower variations which are worth noting. Not which features are phonemic and provide examples of minimal pairs.

Discuss any other systems that may come into play, such as vowel harmony, again providing examples.

Explain if and how vowels interact when in contact with each other: do they form glides or diphthongs, or do they experience hiätus?

## 2.2: Consonantal System

There are XC consonant phonemes in LANGNAME. These are given in the following table:

|           | Bilabial | Alveodental | Palatal | Velar | Glottal |
| --------- | -------- | ----------- | ------- | ----- | ------- |
| Plosive   | p b      | t d         |         | k g   |         |
| Fricative | f v      | s z         | ç ʝ     | x     | h       |
| Affricate | pf       | ts dz       | tç dʝ   |       |         |
| Nasal     | m        | n           |         | ŋ     |         |
| Other     |          | l r         | j       |       |         |
Some consonants may have allophones or experience phonetic processes worth noting.

## 2.3: Stress

How does stress work in your language? Is it predictable or not? Does it interact with some other part of the phonology in unusual ways?

## 2.4: Intonation

Describe the intonation patterns of the language. This usually involves rising and falling pitch or tone across utterances. Be sure to cover the intonation patterns of different types of statements.

## 2.5: Phonotactics & Morphophonemics

What are the phonological constraints of syllables and words in LANGNAME? Are they always open, or may they sometimes be closed? Is there a tendency or preference towards open syllables? Are consonant clusters allowed freely, or in restricted circumstances? Do words borrowed from other languages get to violate these rules? Are there any special cases for word-initial or word-final structures that aren't allowed elsewhere?

What about phonological processes? Is there any form of assimilation, fortition, lenition, or other mutations? Do these cross syllable boundaries? Word boundaries? Are these processes generally progressive (affecting later sounds) or regressive (affecting earlier sounds)?

## 2.6: Orthography

How is LANGNAME written? Does it have its own script, or does it borrow a script from another language or culture? What additions or subtractions (if any), does it make if borrowing a script? How are any irregularities noted in this orthography? Does it mark phonemic variation in general, or in specific dialects?

### 2.6.1: Romanization\*

If LANGNAME has its own script, it may be worth also exploring a romanized\* orthography for the purposes of the grammar documentation, or people who cannot read the native script.
