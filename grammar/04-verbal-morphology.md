# 4: Verbal Morphology

There is no need to place any information in this section before the first sub-heading, but a brief summary of how verbs work or are composed may be suitable.

## 4.1: Verb Formation

What is the morphological structure of LANGNAME? Is there a strict order to the elements of a verb? Can complex verbs be broken down by morphemic analysis? How extensive, and productive, are its inflectional and derivational systems (if any). Is there a trend to a particular size for roots? Are there any other rules in the language that a word must conform to?

Which, if any, of the nominal inflections do verbs agree with?

## 4.2: Voice, Diathesis and Valency

This section explores valency-changing operations on verbs. Specifically, the elements of voice and diathesis, though you may add other valency changing operations as your language uses them. **Diathesis** is defined as the grammatical marking on a verb of the relationship between an *action*, and the *agent* and *patient* of the action. This extends past the simple English *active* and *passive* voices, and also includes categories like *reflexive* and *reciprocal.*

What voicing and valency operations exist in LANGNAME? What do your voices mean when used? You should try to offer some glosses to demonstrate the ways your voices actually work at the sentence level.
## 4.3: Aspect

What if any aspects does LANGNAME have? How are they marked or formed? Are they simple affixes, internal mutations, phrasal, or some combination? What does each aspect actually get used for?

## 4.4: Mood

What if any moods does LANGNAME have? Are they simple or complex? How exactly are they used?

### 4.4.1: Indicative Mood

It's likely that if LANGNAME has any specific moods, the indicative is the least marked and most basic mood, used to derive other conjugations.

## 4.5: Participles

Does your language have participles? How are they formed? How are they used? Are the common or rare? What conjugations do, or can, they take? Do they differ from other verb forms, or follow the same paradigms? How many forms of participles are available, and what are the uses of each form?

## 4.6: Converbs

> Converbs are defined as nonfinite verb forms whose main function is adverbial subordination (Haspelmath, 1995: 3)

Does LANGNAME use converbs? If not, what form can be used to express similar ideas? If so, what converbs or converbal constructions are available?

## 4.7: Verbal Negation

How does LANGNAME handle the negation of verbs? How does it denote the scope of negation, if at all?
