# 10: Lexicon

Doe the LANGNAME lexicon have a variety of terms which reflect the culture and lifestyle of its people, or does it strive to be a broad language, covering things which may be outside of the everyday for most people? What lexical fields are best developed, or least? Where might they have a richer vocabulary than ENGLISH, or another language for comparison? Show some examples of words that reflect on this, where specific words that do not translate one-to-one into English or other languages may exist.

## 10.1: Language Contact

Has LANGNAME been influenced by other languages in its environment? How pervasive are the results of this influence, and in what way does this influence affect speakers of LANGNAME? Has the amount and strength of influence varied throughout time?

What characterizes different periods (if any) of contact with each language? Is language influence primarily one-way, or bidirectional?
